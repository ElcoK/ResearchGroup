Daniel Peregrina is a PhD researcher within the department of Climate Adaptation at Deltares and in the department of Water and Climate Risk (WCR) of the Institute for Environmental Studies (IVM) at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. He completed a bachelorâ€™s degree in Chemical Engineering at Universidad Iberoamericana Mexico City and worked within the consumer-packaged goods industry as an environment, health, and safety manager before pursuing his master's degree in environmental sciences, following the Water Science and Management programme at Utrecht University. For his master's thesis, Daniel researched drought in cities using the hydrology and water resources model PCR-GLOBWB 2.

Daniel's current research with Deltares and the IVM focuses on the appraisal of adaptation strategies for critical infrastructure to multi-hazard climate risks in Europe, which pose a threat to current and future infrastructure; this research includes consecutive, cascading, and compound events.
