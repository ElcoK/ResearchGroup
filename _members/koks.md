Elco Koks is an Assistant Professor within the Water and Climate Risk group at the Institute for Environmental Studies (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam) and a Honorary Research Associate within the Oxford Programme of Sustainable Infrastructure Systems (OPSIS). His research combines knowledge from disaster impact modelling, critical infrastructure, network analysis and macroeconomics. 

He currently supervises nine PhDs that work on the interplay of multi-risk, critical infrastructure risk modelling, network analysis and economic impact analysis.

One of his own specialties is the modelling of the economy-wide consequences of disasters on both a regional and interregional level, focusing on industrial impacts and infrastructure systems. One of the key elements in his research is to integrate natural disaster models with macroeconomic impact models.
