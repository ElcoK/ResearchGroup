Evelyn Mühlhofer is a PhD researcher in the Weather \& Climate Risks Group at ETH Zurich's Institute for Environmental Decisions in Switzerland, and is co-supervised by Elco Koks at the Institute for Environmental Studies (IVM) at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. Her research revolves around natural hazard impacts on critical infrastructure systems and service disruptions. Using network modelling, open-source geospatial data, and the risk assessment platform CLIMADA, she examines how structural damages to infrastructure assets can lead to systemic failure cascades, and their implications for basic service access to the dependent population.  
​
Beforehand, she completed a Bachelors degree in Interdisciplinary Sciences (Physical Chemistry) from ETH Zurich, during which she gained theoretical knowledge at the intersection of physics and chemistry, and practical laboratory experience in environmental and analytical chemistry during several research projects. She went on to pursue a Masters degree in Management, Technology \& Economics, where she transitioned towards a more applied science spectrum. She joined the Weather \& Climate Risks group with a master thesis contrasting actual risk exposure and stated adaptation intentions within countries' Nationally Determined Contributions following the Paris Agreement. After working in project monitoring and evaluation for a Swiss NGO, and a brief stay at the Swiss Meteorological Office (MeteoSwiss), she returned to ETH for her PhD.
