Mengqi Ye is a PhD Candidate in the Department of Water and Climate Risk at the Institute for Environmental Studies (IVM) at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (VU Amsterdam). Mengqiâ€™s research interests bridge three related themes: power infrastructure system-of-systems and risk modelling, resilience of system, and cost-benefit analysis of adaptation options. Her PhD project is funded by the China Scholarship Council (CSC), and aims to improve our understanding of the social economic impacts of climate extremes on power systems and assess adaptation options to enhance system resilience.

Prior to this, Mengqi obtained her Master degree in Natural Disasters at Beijing Normal University (BNU), where her research focused on developing a model to estimate the direct economic losses caused by tropical cyclones in China. Her main research quantitatively connects TC risk to physical and socioeconomic drivers, and emphasizes how human dimensions contribute to TC risk. Moreover, she used this model to estimate TC risk under climate change and future socioeconomic development in the context of China.
