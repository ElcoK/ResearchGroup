Sadhana Nirandjan is a PhD researcher within the department of Water and Climate Risk (WCR) at the Institute for Environmental Studies (IVM) at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. She completed a bachelor’s degree in Earth Sciences and Economics from Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, during which she discovered her interest for interdisciplinary research within hydrological systems and its societal impacts. Before she started her master in Hydrology at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, she had followed extra-curricular courses at Stellenbosch University, South Africa, to gain more knowledge on environmental issues experienced abroad, for which she was awarded the Holland Scholarship. She completed her master’s in Hydrology with a thesis on Managed Aquifer Systems in coastal areas and was awarded the distinction cum laude. 

In her current research, she aims to increase our understanding of the multi-hazard risk to critical infrastructure at the global scale. She developed the Critical Infrastructure Spatial Index (CISI) to identify the geospatial location of critical infrastructure and its density for each part of the world. Other aspects that are covered by her research are, under which, the vulnerability of assets, and the quantification of risks on our critical infrastructure due to natural hazards.
