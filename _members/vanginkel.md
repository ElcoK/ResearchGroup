lastname: VanGinkel
publications: 'author^=*vanginkel'

teaser: >
    My current research focuses on the design of languages for distributed systems
    with a wide range of software architectures – e.g., peer-to-peer, cloud, edge, serverless, IoT –
    regarding sound programming models for the interaction between components,
    their composition, privacy protection issues,
    type systems for reasoning about the placement of data and computation.

My current research focuses on the design of languages for distributed systems
with a wide range of software architectures – e.g., peer-to-peer, cloud, edge, serverless, IoT –
regarding areas such as sound programming models for the interaction between components,
their composition, privacy protection issues,
type systems for reasoning about the placement of data and computation.

Within the [MAKI](https://www.maki.tu-darmstadt.de/){: target="_blank" } project,
I worked on complex event processing (CEP)
and multitier languages for developing modular distributed applications.
I’m the main developer of the [ScalaLoci]({{ '/projects/scala-loci' | relative_url }})
multitier programming language.

I served in the program committee of [ProWeb 2020](https://2020.programming-conference.org/home/proweb-2020){: target="_blank" }
(Workshop on Programming Technology for the Future Web)
at ‹Programming› ’20.


## Short Bio

I got my PhD from the Departement of Computer Science at the Technical University of Darmstadt
under the supervision of Prof. Guido Salvaneschi in 2020.
My doctoral dissertation focuses on multitier programming
for developing distributed software systems.
I worked as a postdoc with Prof. Mira Mezini at the Technical University of Darmstadt until spring 2021.
I joined the Programming Group at the University of St. Gallen in May 2021.
