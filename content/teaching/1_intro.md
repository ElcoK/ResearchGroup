## CIVE97129 - Freight Transport 

Our postgraduate module on Freight Distribution and Supply Chain Management is offered as part of the [Intercollegiate MSc in Transport](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/civil-engineering/prospective-students/postgraduate-taught-admissions/transport-cluster/msc-transport/), run by the [Centre for Transport Studies](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/transport-studies/) at Imperial College London. 

The curriculum covers the principles of inventory management, supply chain network design and freight distribution operations, with a particular emphasis on the application of data science and mathematical optimisation methods.

Sector-specific logistics concepts (ie. healthcare, humanitarian response) and aspects of resilience analysis are also covered.

This module is also available as "stand-alone" course for professionals, as part of our Deparmental Continuing Professional Development (CPD) programme.
