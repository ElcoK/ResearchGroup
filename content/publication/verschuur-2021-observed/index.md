abstract: "Guan and colleagues used a model of the global economy to quantify the impacts of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic under different scenarios of pandemic spreading and lockdown stringencies. Using real-time ship tracking data from before and during the pandemic, we show how the onset of disruption to trade was slower than modelled by Guan et al. Whereas supply chains to some countries with strong trading links to China (for example, Australia and Malaysia) have been affected in ways that resemble the results of their model (although to a lower extent than predicted), others with equally strong links (for example, Vietnam) have managed to increase their trade, contrary to the modelâ€™s predictions. Understanding the propagation of the economic shock from COVID-19, which can be informed by real-time observations as well as model predictions, will help to better allocate international aid and economic stimuli."
