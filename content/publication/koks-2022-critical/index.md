abstract: "Critical infrastructure systems are often considered to be the backbone of modern-day society. Yet, they are both exposed and vulnerable to environmental hazards globally. Affected critical infrastructure is not just costly to repair. Its failure can quickly result in a cascading effect on households, companies, or other infrastructure systems. As such, the identification and assessment of the risks of environmental hazards to critical infrastructure require approaches that can look beyond the direct impacts. This chapter provides an overview of the current state-of-the-art in critical infrastructure risk modelling, examines the close connection between resilience and critical infrastructure, and discusses the importance of including uncertainty metrics in a risk assessment."
