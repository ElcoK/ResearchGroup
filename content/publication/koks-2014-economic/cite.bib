 abstract = {In this paper, we make first steps with applying a methodology consisting of a hybrid interregional input-output
model to assess the economic consequences of large-scale floods for the European economy. The proposed
methodology consists of multiple steps. First, a direct loss assessment is conducted in several flood-prone regions,
based on simulated floods. Second, the direct losses in capital and labor are translated into the loss in production per
sector. Third, the recovery of this production shock is modeled using a hybrid interregional input-output model,
combining non-linear programming and input-output modelling. Consequently, when knowing how much
production is lost (or gained) in each region, the economic consequences can be assessed. Finally, the model
outcome is loss estimation expressed in terms of expected annual damage. To assess these consequences,
interregional supply and use tables are used, consisting of 256 different European NUTS2 regions. This data makes
it possible to model the indirect losses for both the affected region and the rest of Europe in detail. Results show that
regions outside the affected area can have either benefits or losses, depending on the economic relation with the
affected region. Consequently, the overall consequences for the European Union are found to be positive for smallscale floods and negative for large-scale floods. This study shows the large potential of interregional modelling and
the added value of combining different economic loss estimation approaches into an integrative framework.},
