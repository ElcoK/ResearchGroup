abstract: "Germany, Belgium and The Netherlands were hit by extreme precipitation and flooding in July 2021. This Brief Communication provides an overview of the impacts to large-scale critical infrastructure systems and how recovery has progressed during the first six months after the event. The results show that Germany and Belgium were particularly affected, with many infrastructure assets severely damaged or completely destroyed. Impacts range from completely destroyed bridges and sewage systems, to severely damaged schools and hospitals. We find that large-scale risk assessments, often focused on larger (river) flood events, do not find these local, but severe, impacts. This may be the result of limited availability of validation material. As such, this study will not only help to better understand how critical infrastructure can be affected by flooding, but can also be used as validation material for future flood risk assessments."
