 abstract = {Floods have negative effects on the reliable operation of transportation systems. In China alone, floods cause an average of ∼1125 h of railway service disruptions per year. In this study, we present a simulation framework to analyse the system vulnerability and risk of the railway system to floods. First, we developed a novel methodology for generating flood events at both the national and river basin scale. Based on flood hazard maps of different return periods, independent flood events are generated using the Monte Carlo sampling method. Combined with network theory and spatial analysis methods, the resulting event set provides the basis for national- and provincial-level railway risk assessments, focusing in particular on train performance loss. Applying this framework to the Chinese railway system, we show that the system vulnerability of the Chinese railway system to floods is highly heterogeneous as a result of spatial variations in the railway topology and traffic flows. Flood events in the Yangtze River basin show the largest impact on the national railway system, with approximately 40 % of the national daily trains being affected by a 100-year flood event in that basin. At the national level, the average percentage of daily affected trains and passengers for the national system is approximately 2.7 % of the total daily number of trips and passengers. The event-based approach presented in this study shows how we can identify critical hotspots within a complex network, taking the first steps in developing climate-resilient infrastructure.},
