Sadhana Nirandjan is a PhD student in the department of Water and Climate Risk (WCR) of the Institute for Environmental Studies (IVM) at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. She completed a bachelor’s degree in Earth Sciences and Economics from Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, during which she discovered her interest for interdisciplinary research within hydrological systems and its societal impacts. Before she started her master in Hydrology at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, she had followed extra-curricular courses in South Africa to gain more knowledge on environmental issues experienced abroad, for which she was awarded the Holland Scholarship. She completed her master’s in Hydrology with a thesis on Managed Aquifer Systems in coastal areas.

In her current research, she aims to quantify the impacts and the risks of current and future sea-level rise and coastal flooding on Europe’s coastal infrastructure and the European economy. This quantification will be done through a combination of state-of-the-art flood simulation modelling, network analysis and economic impact modelling. This research is part of the RECEIPT project focussing on impacts of climate change on Europe and is funded by the European Commission.
